# F1-2025-PowerBI-dashboard

This dashboard analyzes qualifying data from the first six rounds of the 2025 Formula 1 season (SuperPole format). I did this in a day and I am quite proud with the results, but I want to improve it as the F1 season rolls on.

## 📊 Key Visuals
- Driver % Gap from Pole (Line Chart) - The closer to 100%, the better as the driver is hooked up with their car better than their teammate.
- Team Performance Trends - The closer to 100%, the better as it highlights the team has got better performance across a single lap and have a good setup to go along with it.
- Qualifying Heatmap (Driver Consistency) - Can compare nicely to their teammates when using the slicer.
- The Lap Times set by Drivers and Teams from race to race, showing the raw data in a Line Chart.
- Standard Deviation Graph - Highlights a driver's consistency from Pole (smoothes the data) across the first 6 rounds.

## 🧠 Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (for custom measures) - Averages, STDEVX, Calculate, SUM.
- Power Query (data transformation)
- Excel (original source formatting)
